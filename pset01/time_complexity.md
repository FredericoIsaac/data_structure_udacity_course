# Time Complexity

>Time complexity of an algorithm quantifies the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run as a function of the length of the input. [***Akash Sharma***]

## Task 0

The runtime in task 0 is **O(n)**, n being the number of lines in the csv file, pass by every line of the file, then we get the values that we want in a order of **O(1)**
